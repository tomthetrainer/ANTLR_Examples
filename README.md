ANTLR Examples for when I was trying to figure out how to add spark extensions


You should be able to git clone this and load it into intellij. 

I did not write a gitignore so there is some stuff that is probably not needed, or that might get in the way. 

Like the .idea or .sbt files, 

If you found this on your own through a web search or something there is probably nothing of value here, I just write some g4 files and generate the ANTLR stubs
using the ANTLR tools in intellij, 

I am just learning ANTLR so very basic, a search for the ANTLR docs would serve you better.
